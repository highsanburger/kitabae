\exercise{1}{
Given functions $f : A \to B$ and $g : B \to C$, define their
\textbf{composite} $g \circ f : A \to C$. Show that we have $h \circ (g \circ f ) \equiv (h \circ g) \circ f$.}

\exercise{2}{
  Derive the recursion principle for products  $\text{rec}_{A \times B}$  using
only the projections, and verify that the definitional equalities are valid.
Do the same for $\Sigma$-types.
}

\exercise{3}{
  Derive the induction principle for products $\text{ind}_{A \times B}$, using
only the projections and the propositional uniqueness principle uppt.
Verify that the definitional equalities are valid. Generalize uppt to $\Sigma$-
types, and do the same for $\Sigma$-types. (This requires concepts from Chapter 2.)

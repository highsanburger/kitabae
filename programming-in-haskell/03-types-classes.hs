-- 1. What are the types of the following values?

-- ['a','b','c'] :: [Char]
-- ('a','b',c')  :: (Char,Char,Char)
-- [(False, '0'),(True,'1')] :: [(Bool,Char)]
-- ([False,True],['0','1']) :: ([Bool],[Char])
-- [tail, init, reverse] :: [[a] -> [a]]


-- 2. 2. Write down definitions that have the following types; it does not matter what the definitions actually do as long as they are type correct.

bools :: [Bool]
bools = [True,False]

nums :: [[Int]]
nums = [[1],[2],[3]]

add :: Int -> Int -> Int -> Int
add x y z = x + y + z

copy :: a -> (a,a)
copy x = (x,x)

apply :: (a -> b) -> a -> b
apply f x = f x


-- 3. What are the types of the following functions?

second :: [a] -> a
second xs = head (tail xs)

swap :: (a,b) -> (b,a)
swap (x,y) = (y,x)

pair :: a -> b -> (a,b)
pair x y = (x,y)

double :: Num a => a -> a
double x = x*2

palindrome :: Eq a => [a] -> Bool
palindrome xs = reverse xs == xs

-- f :: a -> b
twice :: (a -> a) -> a -> a
twice f x = f (f x)


-- 4. Check your answers to the preceding three questions using GHCi.

-- 5. Why is it not feasible in general for function types to be instances of the Eq class? When is it feasible? 
-- Hint: two functions of the same type are equal if they always return equal results for equal arguments.
 
-- As domain and codomain is usually infinite. Feasible if the i/p & o/p types are finite
